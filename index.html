      Hi! The name is Luke Firth, it is so nice of you to stop by my page. If
      you have made it this far through my website and have found yourself
      reading my about me blurb then I am assuming you want to know... a little
      about me, so let's get to it! I like to create and and then make things.
      Having worked previously as a Graphic Designer, CNC Programmer & CAD
      Draftsman I was able to manufacture almost anything I thought up
      (obviously and unfortunately I did have some limitations but you get what
      I am saying). I am obsessed with emerging technologies and how they are
      building the innovation of tomorrow, it creatively inspires and motivates
      me. After eight years at my last company I felt it was time to go on a
      self discovery journey and start a fresh new chapter of life growing,
      learning and honing in on my passions. In order to do this it took some
      self reflection to think 1) what am I most ambitious about, 2) can I make
      money doing that thing and 3) will my girlfriend stay with me if I say I
      want to write code every single day for the rest of my life (spoiler, I am
      overly ambitious about the joys of coding). So I quit my full-time job and
      ventured into the world of unemployment (my girlfriend only cried once and
      yes stayed with me) and I signed up to General Assembly's twelve week
      immersive Software Engineering course. I didn't have a life for twelve
      weeks but it was the most alive I have ever been being challenged every
      day and developing into the nerdy man I am at current time. Studying and
      working as a Software Engineer has given me the ability to explore my
      creativity in a new way, being able to mix logic with design. In my down
      time I enjoy diving into a good book (always taking recommendations) and
      drinking expensive coffee whilst eating expensive avo toast at an overly
      expensive cafe. If you're interested in working with me after learning how
      cool and not nerdy I am I would love to enjoy an expensive coffee with you
      sometime, please enquire within. Always and never not sincerely, Your new
      nerdy mate Luke Firth
